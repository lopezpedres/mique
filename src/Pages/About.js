            Welcome to my website. My name is Miguel and I am a full-stack Software Developer. For the past 2 years of self-learning, I have been able to put in practice many technologies, such as JavaScript, Python, SQL, SQLALCHEMY, Postgresql, Express, Docker, React, and more. Currently, and for the past few months, I have been part of Hack for LA Developer’s team, a non-profit organization which principal objective is to give back to the community by creating tech solutions to everyday problems. There, I am able to give maintenance to their principal WebPage as well as learn more about GitHub’s Kanban workflow.
